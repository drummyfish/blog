        <p>As you may have noticed, my website has completely changed its look. There were two reasons for the
        change:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>I wrote the old website completely by myself&nbsp;and I have reached a point when I didn't want to go
          on&nbsp;this way. You probably know this - you start a new project and you don't want to go big, so you start
          with a small thing that you can manage yourself easily. However, if you're having fun with it and keep on
          improving it, the functionality grows - you add a guest book, comments, admin interface - and one day you
          find it too overwhelming for one person to manage and you start to realize the inefficiency of your effort.
          It's better at some point to simply switch to an existing solution that is optimised, well tested and
          flexible. I myself didn't have any experience with web frameworks and so I started searching for one, till I
          found&nbsp;<a href="https://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a>. I am very satisfied so far and we'll see how it
          does in a long run.
          </li>
          <li>I noticed some ads on my website when using a computer without adblock. Of course it was because of my
          free webhosting. I also had a few problems with my files disappearing from the server, even if I wasn't
          breaking&nbsp;any size limits. I therefore decided to find a better webhosting service and I hopefully did, I
          hope I didn't speak too soon.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I've been working on the website for a few weeks by now and you can find all the stuff I had on my old
        website here, plus some extra features thanks to Wordpress. It's mainly multilingualism that I have long wished
        to have, then there is the search bar, tags, sorting, emoticons etc. I hope you'll have fun browsing my new
        website <span class="emoji emoji-smile">:)</span></p>

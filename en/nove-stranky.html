</div>      <p>As you may have noticed, my website has completely changed its
look. There were two reasons for the change:</p>
<ol>
<li>I wrote the old website completely by myself and I have reached a
    point when I didn't want to go on this way. You probably know this -
    you start a new project and you don't want to go big, so you start
    with a small thing that you can manage yourself easily. However, if
    you're having fun with it and keep on improving it, the
    functionality grows - you add a guest book, comments, admin
    interface - and one day you find it too overwhelming for one person
    to manage and you start to realize the inefficiency of your effort.
    It's better at some point to simply switch to an existing solution
    that is optimised, well tested and flexible. I myself didn't have
    any experience with web frameworks and so I started searching for
    one, till I found <a href="https://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a>. I am very
    satisfied so far and we'll see how it does in a long run.</li>
<li>I noticed some ads on my website when using a computer
    without adblock. Of course it was because of my free webhosting. I
    also had a few problems with my files disappearing from the server,
    even if I wasn't breaking any size limits. I therefore decided to
    find a better webhosting service and I hopefully did, I hope I
    didn't speak too soon.</li>
</ol>
<p>I've been working on the website for a few weeks by now and you can find
all the stuff I had on my old website here, plus some extra features
thanks to Wordpress. It's mainly multilingualism that I have long wished
to have, then there is the search bar, tags, sorting, emoticons etc. I
hope you'll have fun browsing my new website <span class="emoji emoji-smile"></span></p>

  <p>Have you ever wanted to make an RPG? I did and so I started a
  project recently. I would like other people to join me and maybe
  we can make a nice game together. I don't feel like typing too
  much so I'll use a bulleted list</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The game is to be purely text-based, running in
    command-line as an "interactive book" which however provides an
    extreme freedom in a similar way Skyrim does. We're not making
    any graphics (not even ASCII), sounds, icons or things like
    that. However in the future I plan to make a wrapper that would
    offer full 3D or 2D graphics experience. By giving up graphics,
    physics and other things in the beginnings we can focus on
    making a quality RPG core that will also be immediately
    playable.</li>

    <li>Everything is open-source, multiplatform, pure C++, KISS,
    using as few libraries as possible and only the ones that are
    also open-source. No one is making any money, we just want to
    make a good game, that's why everyone can contribute only as
    much as they want and only when they want.</li>

    <li>I gather most information (concepts, designs, coding
    conventions etc.) <a href=
    "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jq0dE7DdXIpz_ytLAirXNP6_Oi0MdCSoMdU-_P1p9Lk/edit">
    in this document</a>.</li>

    <li>GitHub: <a href=
    "https://github.com/drummyfish/text-rpg">github.com/drummyfish/text-rpg</a></li>

    <li>project chat: <a href=
    "https://skyrimtextrpg.hipchat.com/invite/407349/c1a6369243e2704c33cbc7bd5c11adf7?utm_campaign=add_users_link">
    HipChat</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Wanna join? All you need to do is fork the GitHub repository,
  write some code and submit it via pull request. Don't know where
  to begin? Just take a look at the UML class diagram in the
  "other" folder on GitHub - you'll find classes that need to be
  implemented there. Or just ask in chat. But We're not only
  looking for programmers, the UML diagram needs to be completed,
  we need to think about the game more, for example what will its
  name be. Just connect to our chat. We're looking forward to
  seeing you <span class="emoji emoji-smile">:)</span></p>
